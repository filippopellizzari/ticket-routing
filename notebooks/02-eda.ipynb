       "This particular account situation that is lately filing on my own credit document has a seriously unfavorable relation to my personal ability to obtain a present loan application. I highly recommend you generate verification that Credit Union has been reported completely in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act regulations, it's really a serious problem to misreport. More confirmation of the aforesaid item too. My proper request must over, I was never 30 days/60 days/120 days late in any of my payments and I'm not greatly tuned in to the date opened so I prefer to ask you be investigated as soon as possible and confirmed to be correct.

       "Chase credit card has changed their credit card so they they can charge cash advance fees on transactions that are \" Cash-like transactions '' even though these are proper credit card transactions that Chase charges their regular fees to the merchant. Examples that Chase has cited, and has charged me for only in 2020 forward is for person to person money transfers ( payments for services ), account-funding ( like freelancer, or payments for service on XXXX ) and transactions that include currency transfer. Also included is using a 3rd party service for bill payments. \\n\\nThese transactions are not cash advances. And hence should not treated like cash advances. The full credit card merchant fees were paid. Chase is trying to make more money from made up fees and taking advantage of the consumer. \\n\\nThese types of transactions have been happening on XXXX for decades and other companies. Chase is trying keep a monopoly while squeezing out the other competitors. \\n\\nAnd they are trying to make more money off fees instead of legitimate banking. \\n\\nVisa has allowed a MERCHANT category for these transactions. However this is a MERCHANT categeory and not a Transaction category which would show if this is a real cash advance or not. \\n\\nChase has no additional cost to these regular transactions as they are simply a credit card transaction like a purchase of anything else. \\n\\nChase needs to be stopped from gouging the consumer with these extra fees that are hard to even assess when I am making the transaction to pay for a service. \\n\\nXXXX card has no such fees. nor do their try to take advantage of the customer with all these obtuse fees.

       "Chase has completely misled me regarding financial assistance programs and payments regarding that program. I fell behind on my credit card payments in early XXXX while searching for work after the birth of my son and my account was closed as a result. When I was financially stable, I contacted Chase to provide me with a program that would allow me to bring my account current and make monthly payments. This was XXXX of XXXX. I was informed by a Chase representative that I would make a {$400.00} payment to bring my account current and then I can make a monthly payment of {$110.00} until the balance was completely paid in full. I distinctly asked if I would be able to make this payment until my balance was paid off and the answer was yes. I was also informed that the $ 110 monthly payment was more than the monthly amount due, so I would actually be able to pay off the balance faster. Automatic draft payments were set up from my bank account on XX/XX/XXXX to ensure I would never miss a payment. However, in XX/XX/XXXX, my credit score decreased by 31 points on XXXX and 21 points on XXXX  and XXXX due to being behind payments over 30 days. Even though for a year every {$110.00} payment successfully came from my bank account, never late. I was completely baffled, so I contacted Chase. I was informed by XXXX ( an Account Supervisor ) that the I was not on a fixed monthly payment assistance program as I was told Im XX/XX/XXXX, but the program was just to bring my account current. Once I made the {$400.00} payment, Chase was at will to utilize a variable interest rate to change my monthly payment from that point on. I was protected from this variable interest rate until XX/XX/XXXX because I was under a promotion that allowed me to pay 0 % APR. Once that expired, I had a near 25 % rate and increasing the minimum monthly payment to over {$110.00}. Since I overpaid the minimum due for about 6 months, it wasnt until XXXX that I was shorting my monthly payments. This would not have been an issue if Chase had simply contacted me to let me know the changes on my account. However, I was not informed of ANYTHING. Chase has my email, phone, and address, but I received 0 attempts at contact. XXXX at Chase said that she sees MULTIPLE statements were being returned back to Chase undelivered ( proving I had not received the information ) and that the phone number ( that I had for over 10 years ) was deemed disconnected after ONE attempt to call me in XXXX of XXXX. Additionally, no emails were sent to notify me of my account because it was a closed account ; however, Chase continued to send me promotional emails. I explained my issues with the lack of communication and the misleading of the assistance programs and XXXX issued an investigation. The investigation returned results that were not in my favor because Chase had effectively tried to reach out to me regardless of it being clear that they NEVER spoke to me regarding the changes in my account. It is clear that I had no issues making payments because they were being paid on time for an entire year. I would have gladly made adjustment to my automatic payments had I known that the rate had changed. I am now on a new assistance program ; however, my credit still reflects a lowered credit score after Chases poor service to contact me regarding my payment changes on my account. I have even disputed with each credit reporting agency and nothing has changed because their records show that on XX/XX/XXXX I am {$28.00} past due. My issue is that a Chase representative told me that I can make $ 110 monthly payments until my balance was paid off, set up automatic payments, and then Chase NEVER informed me of the changes on my account, which was the reason I fell behind and caused a 21-31 point decrease in my credit score.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 0.000015\n",
       "Summary : An email intrusion of a tour company named XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX with which I was doing business caused me to send a wire transfer in the amount of {$3800.00} from my Chase Bank account to a Chase Bank account belonging to someone named XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, CA. After the wire transfer was sent, on XX/XX/2020, XXXX XXXX XXXX informed us immediately that their email had been hacked and that they did not send the request for funds to be transferred. The message we received was fraudulent and a scam. The company told us to cancel the transaction immediately. We learned from the company that the owner of the recipient account, XXXX XXXX, is not an authorized company representative and is not authorized to receive payments for the company 's services. \\n\\nThe same day that the wire was sent, I submitted a wire recall request and reported the fraudulent circumstances to XXXX XXXX at a Chase Bank branch. He filed a fraud case with Chase and attempted to initiate a wire recall. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/2020, I learned from XXXX that Chase had asked XXXX whether the transaction was legitimate. She said it was. In response I sent XXXX to send on to departments at Chase evidence of the fraudulent nature of the transaction. \\n\\nIt took over six weeks and repeated communications by XXXX to Chases wire and claim departments before we could get a response. On XX/XX/2020, I learned from XXXX that the wire recall failed because the money had already been moved out of the recipient account. \\n\\nWe would like to recover the wired amount because this transaction was made under false pretenses and fraudulent and illegitimate circumstances. \\n\\nDetails and Timeline of the Case : XX/XX/2020 : After we wired a 25 % deposit on an upcoming trip to XXXX with four traveling companions on XX/XX/2020 to XXXX XXXX XXXX legitimate business bank account in XXXX, my traveling companions and I received a message from the same email address ( XXXX ) we had been using to correspond with the company. This message requested an additional deposit of 50 % or the total balance for the trip be sent to a U.S. account because of currency fluctuations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This contradicts our previous communications with the legitimate company, who requires payment of the balance on arrival in cash after receiving the 25 % deposit. After some correspondence back and forth, we agreed to send the wire transfer on the account that we assumed this was the same contact using the same email address with whom we had been in touch before. \\n\\nThe impersonator on the email sent bank details for a Chase Bank account held by an individual with the name of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, CA, claiming that she was XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX representative in the United States. I asked for contact information for XXXX. The impersonator gave an email address, XXXX. I corresponded with this email address to confirm payment and bank details. The operator of that email address confirmed the details. Those bank details were : Account Holder : XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX Routing Number : XXXX Beneficiary Address : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX CA XXXX Bank Address : XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX I initiated a wire transfer in the amount of {$3800.00} from my Chase Bank online account. The wire was scheduled to go out on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX because it was initiated after hours on this Friday. \\n\\nXX/XX/2020 : We receive a message from the same email address and person who was impersonating XXXX XXXX XXXX representative that the recipient bank details for the wire transfer have changed. According to the message we received, XXXX received a call from Chase Bank that the wire I sent will be returned back to me because XXXX had reached a monthly limit of accepting wire transfers. The email gave these details for another Chase Bank account : Account Holder : XXXX XXXX Beneficiary Address : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX CA XXXX Bank Address : XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, CA Bank Name : Chase Bank Account Type : Checking Account number : XXXX Routing number : XXXX I canceled the existing scheduled wire transfer and scheduled a new one to be sent to the second bank account. Because this was on a Saturday, the wire would not be sent until Monday. \\n\\nXX/XX/2020 : Chase Bank sends the wire transfer in the morning to the offending account. I emailed both XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX to inform them that the wire was sent. Immediately after I sent the message, one of my traveling companions contacted me to say that I should cancel the wire transfer immediately on the advice of the tour company. The tour company informed us via XXXX that their email system had been hacked and that they did not tell us to wire the rest of our trip cost. I immediately requested a recall request with Chase Bank online. I also went to a Chase bank branch and spoke with XXXX XXXX, the branch manager, so that I could file a case with their fraud department and initiate a wire recall request. XXXX took these actions after speaking with the fraud and wire departments at XXXX. \\n\\nXX/XX/2020 : I file a complaint about the case with the FBIs XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX with details about the email hack and the fraudulent requests to wire money. \\n\\nXX/XX/2020 : XXXX informs me that Chase had asked XXXX about the legitimacy of the transaction. She says that it was legitimate, which is false. To further bolster our case, I send XXXX supporting documentation outlining how the fraud occurred, including : - A summary and timeline of what happened - A signed and stamped letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX testifying that the wire transfer was not requested by them and that their email had been hacked - Passport of the company 's founder, XXXX XXXX XXXX, to prove his identification - Emails with the hacked address along with an email address that claims to belong to XXXX XXXX - Screenshots of XXXX messages with a legitimate representative of the company, which is how we first found out that this was a case of fraud - Evidence from the company that someone had illegitimately set up an email forward from the company 's main email address to an unauthorized account to correspond with unsuspecting clients like us. \\n\\nXXXX sent these documents to the relevant departments within Chase Bank. \\n\\nXX/XX/2020 : After repeated calls to XXXX to get updates over the past weeks, and, in turn, repeated calls by XXXX to both the claims, wire, and fraud departments at XXXX, I learned from XXXX that the wire recall failed because the money had already been moved out of the recipient fraudsters account. He also told me that Chases fraud department did not consider the case fraud because I had authorized the transaction and my bank account had not been hacked. This is despite me giving supporting evidence about the fraudulent and false circumstances under which I initiated this wire transfer.    0.000015\n",
       "I have had flawless credit for 30 yrs. I've had Chase credit cards, \" Chase Freedom '' specifically since XXXX with no problems ever. I've done many balance transfers in my life, so I have plenty of experience. I recently did a balance transfer with Chase Freedom for {$9000.00} ( did many with other Chase cards, but apparently not \" Freeedom '' ) When I got my first bill, my minimum payment was {$470.00}. I was SHOCKED. I immediately called on XX/XX/XXXX. The representative told me that the min payment was so high bc they were making me pay the \" Balance transfer fee '' up front, but my future payments would be around {$90.00}, 1 % of total balance ( which is standard, AND the rate THEY ADVERTISE ) I went to pay the next payment on XX/XX/XXXX & was once again SHOCKED to see my minimum payment was {$440.00}. I paid it, but I have been trying to work this out with Chase ever since. Apparently, the representative was WRONG & I am actually expected to pay 5 %, instead of the standard 1 % they normally charge, bc that was written in my \" user agreement '' paperwork back in XX/XX/XXXX!! 28 years ago!!! They currently charge 1 % to everyone else in the world. My other cards, including Chase, are all 1 %. This {$440.00} is an unreasonable amt to expect someone to pay for 1 credit card. I have kids & many other bills to pay. They never warned me they were so \" off the charts '' with their minimum payment percentage, ( except for my original paperwork in XX/XX/XXXX ). They offer everyone else 1 % terms. They change THEIR \" terms '' anytime it benefits THEM, but won't budge to lower it to make this payment more affordable & reasonable. So, I also asked them ( as soon as I found this out ) to refund my {$360.00} transfer fee so I could use it to transfer the balance to a different card with a more reasonable minimum payment. They refused. I also asked if they would transfer to my CHASE SLATE card, which has 1 % min pmt, they also refused. They will not work with me at all. I am a responsible working person. I would like to preserve my good credit.
